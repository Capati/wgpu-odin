/*
In-progress recording of a render pass: a list of render commands in a
`CommandEncoder`.

It can be created with `CommandEncoderBeginRenderPass`, whose
`RenderPassDescriptor` specifies the attachments (textures) that will be
rendered to.

Most of the procedures for `RenderPass` serve one of two purposes, identifiable
by their names:

* `Draw*()`: Drawing (that is, encoding a render command, which, when executed
  by the GPU, will rasterize something and execute shaders).
* `Set*()`: Setting part of the [render
  state](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#renderstate) for future drawing
  commands.

A render pass may contain any number of drawing commands, and before/between
each command the render state may be updated however you wish; each drawing
command will be executed using the render state that has been set when the
`Draw*()` procedure is called.

Corresponds to [WebGPU `GPURenderPassEncoder`](
https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#render-pass-encoder).

Sets the active bind group for a given bind group index. The bind group layout

`Limits.minStorageBufferOffsetAlignment` appropriately.
