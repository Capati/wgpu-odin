# RenderLink Framework (WIP)

The RenderLink Framework is a utility designed to simplify working with wgpu, inspired by the user-friendly approaches of LÃ–VE (Love2D) and Raylib. Initially created for examples, it has now evolved into a utility that I plan to expand. This framework abstracts the initialization process, allowing you to dive into wgpu development without getting bogged down in setup details.

Check out the [examples](./../../examples/) to learn more.
