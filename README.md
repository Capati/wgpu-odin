# WGPU Odin Bindings

Bindings to [wgpu-native](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native) **0.17.0.2** in the [Odin programming language](https://odin-lang.org/).

## Status

> **Note**
>
> The wgpu-API still in the "Working Draft" phase. Until the specification is stabilized, break changes can happen without notice.

## Dynamic Linking

There is library files generated into the root `bindings/lib/` folder, `wgpu_native.dll.lib` on Windows, `libwgpu_native.so` on Linux, and `libwgpu_native.dylib` on Mac. On Windows you need `wgpu_native.dll` along side your executable. All those files are autogenerated binary modules and you can download on wgpu-native releases page:

<https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native/releases>

## Bindings only

You can use the bindings only where the procedures are called directly from the `foreign` block.

## Wrapper

The wrapper version exposes an API similar to the [WebGPU spec](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/). Most of the inner procedures are boilerplate code that create an convenient way to work with Odin and wgpu data.

## Quick Start Guide

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a folder `libs/wgpu` in the root of your project (from where you run `odin build`).
3. If you want the wrapper version, copy both the `bindings` and `wrapper` folders from this repository to the directory created in the previous step.
4. To easily import the package to your project, you can set a `collection`:

```
odin build ./src -collection:libs=./libs
```

5. Import the package:

```
import wgpu "libs:wgpu/wrapper"
```

Or

```
import wgpu "libs:wgpu/bindings"
```

## Naming Conventions

Types and values follow the [Odin Naming Convention](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/wiki/Naming-Convention). In general, `Ada_Case` for types and `snake_case` for values

|                    | Case                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Import Name        | snake_case (but prefer single word) |
| Types              | Ada_Case                            |
| Enum Values        | Ada_Case                            |
| Procedures         | snake_case                          |
| Local Variables    | snake_case                          |
| Constant Variables | SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE                |
