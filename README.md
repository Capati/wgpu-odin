## Dynamic Linking

There is library files generated into the root `lib/` folder, `wgpu_native.dll.lib` on Windows, `libwgpu_native.so` on Linux, and `libwgpu_native.dylib` on Mac. On Windows you need `wgpu_native.dll` along side your executable, you can find it on `bin/` folder. All those files are autogenerated binary modules and you can download on wgpu-native releases page:
