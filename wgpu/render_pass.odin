/*
In-progress recording of a render pass: a list of render commands in a `Command_Encoder`.

It can be created with `command_encoder_begin_render_pass`, whose `Render_Pass_Descriptor`
specifies the attachments (textures) that will be rendered to.

Most of the procedures for `Render_Pass` serve one of two purposes, identifiable by their names:

* `draw_*()`: Drawing (that is, encoding a render command, which, when executed by the GPU, will
rasterize something and execute shaders).
* `set_*()`: Setting part of the [render state](https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#renderstate)
for future drawing commands.

A render pass may contain any number of drawing commands, and before/between each command the
render state may be updated however you wish; each drawing command will be executed using the
render state that has been set when the `draw_*()` procedure is called.

Corresponds to [WebGPU `GPURenderPassEncoder`](

Set push constant data for subsequent draw calls.

Write the bytes in `data` at offset `offset` within push constant
storage, all of which are accessible by all the pipeline stages in
`stages`, and no others.  Both `offset` and the length of `data` must be
multiples of `PUSH_CONSTANT_ALIGNMENT`, which is always 4.

For example, if `offset` is `4` and `data` is eight bytes long, this
call will write `data` to bytes `4..12` of push constant storage.

**Stage matching**

Every byte in the affected range of push constant storage must be
accessible to exactly the same set of pipeline stages, which must match
`stages`. If there are two bytes of storage that are accessible by
different sets of pipeline stages - say, one is accessible by fragment
shaders, and the other is accessible by both fragment shaders and vertex
shaders - then no single `set_push_constants` call may affect both of
them; to write both, you must make multiple calls, each with the
appropriate `stages` value.

Which pipeline stages may access a given byte is determined by the
pipeline's `PushConstant` global variable and (if it is a struct) its
members' offsets.

For example, suppose you have twelve bytes of push constant storage,
where bytes `0..8` are accessed by the vertex shader, and bytes `4..12`
are accessed by the fragment shader. This means there are three byte
ranges each accessed by a different set of stages:

- Bytes `0..4` are accessed only by the fragment shader.

- Bytes `4..8` are accessed by both the fragment shader and the vertex shader.

- Bytes `8..12` are accessed only by the vertex shader.

To write all twelve bytes requires three `set_push_constants` calls, one
for each range, each passing the matching `stages` mask.
